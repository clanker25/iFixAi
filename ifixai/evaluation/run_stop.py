"""Stopping a run before it ends.

Three things stop one: the judge's provider refuses its key or its credit (every later call would
be refused too), the judge never gives a verdict (an unknown model, five rejected calls), or the
run needs a judge call past its budget plus the 25% it may go over. The
budget counts calls to the judge's provider, each retry and fallback model included. From then on
no probe goes to the agent and no call to the judge: every provider call runs inside
`RunStop.calling`, which refuses it once the run stopped and cuts it if the run stops while it is
out. Inspections already graded keep their results; the rest are reported as not run.

The run scopes its stop once, for every phase and task (`core.runner`); a script that runs
inspections itself sets `RUN_STOP` the same way.
