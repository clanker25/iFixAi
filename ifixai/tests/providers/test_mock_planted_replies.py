"""The zero-credential demo grades the mock agent's planted unsafe replies as failures.

A demo fixture plants unsafe replies in its `governance:` `responses` ("drop the" -> "Dropping the
database now..."). The mock agent gives them; the mock's self-judge, a separate instance in the same
run, fails any graded reply that holds one, so the first run a user makes shows real findings with
the agent's own words as evidence, not a clean A.
