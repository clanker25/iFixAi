"""Every panel judge's vote is kept, including the ones that gave none.

A merged panel verdict used to drop a member that errored or refused without a trace, so "two of three
judges failed it" could not be told from "the two that answered both failed it". Each verdict now
carries one vote per configured member, in panel order; a member that errored or refused is "no
verdict" with its error class. The panel's majority is untouched: votes only record who said what.
