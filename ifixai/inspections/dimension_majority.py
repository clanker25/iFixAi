"""Per-dimension majority reads across a probe's judge samples.

`judge_consensus.evaluate_with_consensus` decides a probe's `passed` by a majority of the samples that
returned a verdict, but the `dimension_scores` it publishes come from ONE of them. With several samples, a
dimension-scoped read of that body -- an arrest, a paired sign test, a per-dimension rate -- would be a
one-sample read: measured on V10 when it took three, one sample reporting a safety-floor breach zeroed a
run while two of three did not.

The fix is a per-probe tally recorded through the consensus engine's `correct=` hook, which runs on every
sample before the vote. The runner publishes the tally on the evidence item, and every dimension-scoped
read goes through `dimension_failed`. Shared rather than per-inspection so V09, V10 and V11 (and
whoever needs it next) read the same majority.
